# Backstage Deployment Procedure

## Overview
This document outlines the automated procedure for deploying and updating a Backstage instance using Docker. The procedure includes error handling to ensure the installation remains in a working state during updates.

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of command line operations.

## Local Testing
1. **Build the Docker image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t backstage-app .
   ```
2. **Run the Backstage instance**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name backstage-app -p 7007:7007 backstage-app
   ```
3. **Access the application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:7007`.

## Deployment and Update Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```
2. **Run the deployment script**:
   ```bash
   bash deploy.sh
   ```

## Error Handling
The deployment script includes error handling. If any step fails, the script will exit, and the existing Backstage instance will remain unaffected.

## Conclusion
This procedure provides a resilient way to deploy and update a Backstage instance. For any issues or further assistance, please refer to the Backstage documentation or reach out for help.
